    <h1>Coraline</h1>

    <p>
        Once upon a time, in a strange and mysterious house, there lived a little girl named Coraline. <br><br>
        Coraline discovered a hidden door in her new home, leading to a parallel world that was almost like her own.<br><br>
        But in this world, everything was a little too perfect, and the people had buttons for eyes.<br><br>
        As Coraline explored further, she realized that this seemingly wonderful place was actually filled with dark secrets.<br><br>
        The “Other Mother” wanted Coraline to stay forever, but Coraline was determined to escape and return to her real life.<br><br>
        With bravery and clever thinking, Coraline fought against the sinister forces and eventually found her way back home.<br><br>
        In the end, she learned that her real life, despite its imperfections, was more valuable than any fantasy.<br><br>
        And so, Coraline lived happily ever after, cherishing the freedom she had reclaimed.<br><br>
